        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Granulated Sugar</li>

            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar</li>
            <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat well</li>
            <li>Add the melted chocolate</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl combine the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder and salt</li>
            <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients</li>
            <li>Add the unmelted chocolate chunks.</li> 
            <li>Form 15 cookies and place on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Cook for 12 to 13 minutes at 350 degrees.</li>

             <h2>Tres Leches Cake</h2>
        <span>Origin: Latin America</span>
        <span>Source: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7399/tres-leches-milk-cake/</span>
        <span>Category: Dessert</span>

        <img src="https://www.theplazarestaurant.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tres-leches-cake-66-200x300.jpg" width = "400" alt="">
        <p>This cake is a staple at any Latin birthday or celebration. While I haven’t learned exactly how to make it, if you ask any aunt or mother they’ll typically know how to make it and have their own secrets and tips to make it the “best way.” The cake is typically very moist and is best eaten wet.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan.
</li>
            <li>Sift flour and baking powder together; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla; beat well. Add flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until well blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Pierce cake all over with a fork; let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Mix whole milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk together in a bowl; pour over the top of the cooled cake and allow to soak in.</li>
            <li>Add the unmelted chocolate chunks.</li> 
            <li>Whip cream, remaining 1 cup of sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until thick. Spread over the top of the filling. Keep cake refrigerated until serving.</li>
        </ol>
